Single words for names of stuff


Verify en-US is the default culture.

!|Insert|Word|
|value|
|Zippy|

!|Ordered Query| SELECT id, culture FROM Word WHERE value = 'Zippy'|
|id|culture|
|fail[NULL]|1033|

The word table should be case insensitive, but will use the DB2 way and use and UPPER(value) index.
!|Query| SELECT value FROM Word WHERE UPPER(value) = UPPER('zippY')|
|value|
|Zippy|

Longest Word
!|Insert|Word|
|value|
|12345678901234567890|
!|Ordered Query| SELECT id FROM Word WHERE UPPER(value) = UPPER('12345678901234567890')|
|id|
|fail[NULL]|

English, Spanish and Programming words.
All words with the same meaning should have the same id. So id can't be a primary key.

Words used inside software only should not have culture set
!|Insert|Word|
|id|culture|value|
|0|NULL|title|

Should still be able to insert an en-US version of the word
!|Insert|Word|
|id|culture|value|
|0|1033|Title|

!|Insert|Culture|
|code|name|
|2058|es-MX|

http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Title
!|Insert|Word|
|id|culture|value|
|0|2058|TÃ­tulo|

Be sure we have all the different versions of the word Title
NULLs should display first when order is descending.
!|Ordered Query| SELECT id,culture FROM Word WHERE id = 0 ORDER BY culture DESC|
|id|culture|
|0|NULL|
|0|2058|
|0|1033|
